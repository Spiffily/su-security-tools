Security Tools for Super Users

## lscron
lscron.sh is a tool for listing the contents of all crontabs on a Linux system. It must be run as root.

Dependencies: figlet (optional), most (pager)

NOTE: To change the pager, change the end of line 27 to less or more. I used most because it colorizes the content and makes it easier to see what's going on.

## updater-advanced
updater-advanced.sh is a tool for updating and upgrading an Ubuntu system to latest LTS. Is mostly automated. Recommended to run as root or in a root shell.
